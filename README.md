# CoNLLCorefModules
This repository provides support for bracketed coreference in the CoNLL shared task coreference style, within the Pepper converter framework (see https://u.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper). Both an Exporter module and an Importer module is provided.

Pepper is a pluggable framework to convert a variety of linguistic formats (like [TigerXML](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/werkzeuge/TIGERSearch/doc/html/TigerXML.html), the [EXMARaLDA format](http://www.exmaralda.org/), [PAULA](http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/paula.html) etc.) into each other. Furthermore Pepper uses Salt (see https://github.com/korpling/salt), the graph-based meta model for linguistic data, which acts as an intermediate model to reduce the number of mappings to be implemented. This means converting data from a format _A_ to a format _B_ consists of two steps. First the data is mapped from format _A_ to Salt and second from Salt to format _B_. This detour reduces the number of Pepper modules from _n<sup>2</sup>-n_ (in the case of a direct mapping) to _2n_ to handle  n formats.

![n:n mappings via SaltNPepper](./gh-site/img/puzzle.png)

In Pepper there are three different types of modules:
* importers (to map a format _A_ to a Salt model)
* manipulators (to map a Salt model to a Salt model, e.g. to add additional annotations, to rename things to merge data etc.)
* exporters (to map a Salt model to a format _B_).

For a simple Pepper workflow you need at least one importer and one exporter. This project currently supplies an importer and an exporter for the CoNLL Coref format.

## Requirements
Since the module provided here is a plugin for Pepper, you need an instance of the Pepper framework. If you do not already have a running Pepper instance, click on the link below and download the latest stable version (not a SNAPSHOT):

> Note:
> Pepper is a Java based program, therefore you need to have at least Java 7 (JRE or JDK) on your system. You can download Java from https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html or http://openjdk.java.net/ .


## Install module
If this Pepper module is not yet contained in your Pepper distribution, you can easily install it. Just open a command line and enter one of the following program calls:

**Windows**
```
pepperStart.bat 
```

**Linux/Unix**
```
bash pepperStart.sh 
```

Then type in command *is* and the path from where to install the module:
```
pepper> update de.hu_berlin.german.korpling.saltnpepper::pepperModules-CoNLLCorefModules::https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/maven2/
```

## Usage
To use this module in your Pepper workflow, put the following lines into the workflow description file. Note the fixed order of xml elements in the workflow description file: &lt;importer/>, &lt;manipulator/>, &lt;exporter/>. The CoNLLCorefExporter is an exporter module, which can be addressed by one of the following alternatives.
A detailed description of the Pepper workflow can be found on the [Pepper project site](https://u.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper). 

### a) Identify the module by name

```xml
<importer name="CoNLLCorefImporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
```
or
```xml
<exporter name="CoNLLCorefExporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
```

### b) Identify the module by formats

```xml
<importer formatName="ConllCoref" formatVersion="1.0" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
```
or
```xml
<exporter formatName="ConllCoref" formatVersion="1.0" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
```

### c) Use properties

```xml
<importer name="CoNLLCorefImporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS">
  <property key="PROPERTY_NAME">PROPERTY_VALUE</property>
</importer>
```

or

```xml
<exporter name="CoNLLCorefExporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS">
  <property key="PROPERTY_NAME">PROPERTY_VALUE</property>
</exporter>
```

# <a name="details1">CoNLLCorefImporter</a>

## Properties

|name of property			|possible values		|default value|	
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
|ConllCoref.namespace			    |String           |'coref'|
|ConllCoref.relType			    |String           |'coref'|
|ConllCoref.spanAnnotationName			    |String           |'entity'|
|ConllCoref.spanAnnotationValue			    |String           |'entity'|

### namespace

The name of the Salt layer or namespace to assign to imported spans. Default is "coref".

### relType

Name of the edge type to assign to two spans belonging to the same output ID, e.g. 'coref'. .

### spanAnnotationName

Name of an annotatiton to add to all imported spans.. Default is 'entity', set to empty string to prevent annotations being added (may then not be exported in some output formats).

### spanAnnotationValue

Value of an annotatiton to add to all imported spans. Default is 'entity', meaning together with the previous setting, all spans are annotated with entity="entity".

## Example input format

The input gives at least three columns: a numerical token index, which is ignored, the token in the next column and potentially multiple coreference IDs in the last column (intervening columns are ignored). Clashes in the coref column are prevented via pipes (e.g. a line can include a column `(23|48)` to indicate ID 23 opening and 48 closing, though this can also be written as "48)(23" ).

## Properties

|name of property			|possible values		|default value|	
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
|ConllCoref.Exporter.NodeLayer			    |String           |''|
|ConllCoref.Exporter.EdgeType  |String       |''|
|ConllCoref.Exporter.EdgeAnno  |String       |''|
|ConllCoref.Exporter.OutputAnnotation  |String       |''|
|ConllCoref.Exporter.OutputSuffixAnnotation  |String       |''|
|ConllCoref.Exporter.RemoveSingletons  |true,false       |false|
|ConllCoref.Exporter.RemoveEmptyTokens  |true,false       |false|

### NodeLayer

The name of the Salt layer identifying spans to be exported. Default is "", meaning any span will be exported.

### EdgeType

Name of the edge type identifying two spans as belonging to the same output ID, e.g. 'coref'. Can be supplied as a regular expression matching multiple edge types. Default is '' (any pointing relation detected in data - 
usually not a good idea if your data contains both dependencies and coreference).

### EdgeAnno

A String supplying a single, space separated key-value pair denoting a required edge annotation for including a pointing relation. Both the annotation name and value can be regular expressions, but may not contain the equals sign. For example: `coref_type=ana|appos` will cause only pointing relations with an annotation `coref_type` and value matching `ana` or `appos` to be considered. Default is '' (no annotation is required).

### OutputAnnotation

A String supplying an annotation key that exported nodes have, whose annotation value will be added to the beginning of the bracketed output for each node. For example: `entity` will cause any annotation named entity to have its value prefixed to the coref identifier, so a bracket ID like `(1` which is the beginning of a span entity=person would become `(person-1`. Default is '' (no annotation is outputted).

### OutputSuffixAnnotation

A String supplying an annotation key that exported nodes have, whose annotation value will be added to the end of the bracketed output for each node. For example: `identity` will cause any annotation named identity to have its value suffixed to the coref identifier, so a bracket ID like `(1` which is the beginning of a span identity=United_States would become `(1-United_States`. Default is '' (no annotation is outputted).

### RemoveSingletons

Boolean, whether to include nodes matching the NodeLayer, even if they are not connected to any other node via a pointing relation (i.e. singletons). Default is false, meaning singletons are included.

### RemoveEmptyTokens

Boolean, whether to remove empty tokens, i.e. tokens containing only whitespace or a zero-length string. Default is false, meaning empty tokens are included.

## Example output format

The output gives three columns: zero based token index, the token and potentially multiple coreference IDs. Clashes are prevented via pipes (e.g. a line can include a column `(23|48)` to indicate ID 23 opening and 48 closing)
